					<p><strong>Synthetic oil</strong> is engineered for superior performance. It flows better in cold weather, resists breakdown in hot temperatures, and lasts longer (5,000-7,500+ miles). Many newer vehicles require synthetic oil - check your owner's manual.</p>
					<p>Not sure which is right for your vehicle? Our Nashville mechanics will check your manufacturer's recommendations and help you choose the best option for your car and budget.</p>
